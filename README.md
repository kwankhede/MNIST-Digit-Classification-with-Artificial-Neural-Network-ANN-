# MNIST Digit Classification with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Introduction

In this project, we will build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) in grayscale, where each image is 28x28 pixels.

## Project Overview

1. **Setting Up the Project**
    - Install required packages

    - Load and preprocess the data
    - Visualize the data

2. **Build and Train the ANN**
    - Define the model architecture
    - Compile the model
    - Train the model
    - Evaluate the model
    - Plot training history

3. **Make Predictions**
    - Use the trained model to make predictions
    - Visualize predictions

4. **Conclusion**
    - Summary of the project
    - Key highlights
    - Future improvements
